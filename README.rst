LSST the Docs: Dasher
#####################

**Versioning** is a core feature of LSST the Docs.
By default, the documentation of every branch and tag of a Git repository is available through separate URLs.
LTD Dasher creates lightweight dashboards, available at `(product).lsst.io/v` and `(product).lsst.io/builds`, that help users find the right version of project's documentation.
For more information about LSST the Docs' versioned documentation, see `SQR-006`_.

LTD Dasher is a Kubernetes-deployed microservice that works with `LTD Keeper`_.
